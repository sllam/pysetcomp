Introduction
############

pysetcomp is a lightweight Python library that extends the popular Z3 SMT solver with the ability to reason about the satisfiability of set comprehension patterns.

For more information on how pysetcomp works, see our paper "Reasoning About Set Comprehension", which can be found at http://www.qatar.cmu.edu/~sllam/ .

##################
Basic Requirements
##################

i) Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/)

ii) z3Py: Python APIs for z3 SMT Solver (Check https://z3.codeplex.com/ for installation details)

iii) A love for comprehending set comprehensions

* Currently only tested on Ubuntu, but do try on other platforms and feel free to report any bugs or issues to us!
